## 🧪 Admin Login Credentials

```text
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

> You can change the credentials in the database (`registration` table).

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Inputs are handled with basic PHP validation
* Admin authentication prevents unauthorized access
* ⚠️ Passwords are stored as plaintext – **recommend using `password_hash()`** in production
* ⚠️ SQL queries are vulnerable to injection – consider using **prepared statements** (PDO or MySQLi)

---

## 📈 Possible Improvements

* ✅ Implement prepared statements for secure DB access
* ✅ Use hashed passwords (`password_hash()` and `password_verify()`)
* ✅ Add logout confirmation and session timeout
* ✅ Add profile pictures or document upload for students
* ✅ Integrate AJAX for dynamic content (e.g., live search)
* ✅ Add analytics dashboard for admin
* ✅ Implement role-based access (admin, teacher, clerk)
